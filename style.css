Description: 	Siuy is a specialized WordPress theme dedicated to blogging, and it is primarily made for the minimalistic book and writing lovers. The minimalist implementation eliminates all elements that clutter the page, and it complements your content perfectly while getting rid of unnecessary animations and slideshows while you can make your bold statement loud and clear with using theme's Jumbotron component and thanks to Schema.org markup integration, your blog has a better chance of climbing those hyper-competitive rankings. Siuy uses a live customizer to arrange all things in real time, and it has several pre-built choices for header, footer, and even blog feed layouts. Things that would have cost you thousands upon thousands of dollars if you went to an agency are available for a minute fraction of that price. If you like simplicity for news, stories and other writings, then Siuy is ready to blog!
